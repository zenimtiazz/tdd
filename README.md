### What are unit tests?
Unit testing is testing small pieces of your code in isolation with test code. So instead of going to your browser and verifying everything works, you create a piece of code that checks if another piece of code works.

### What is PHPUnit?
[PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) is the PHP version of the [xUnit architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) for unit testing frameworks. This means that many other languages have their own version of this unit testing framework. This means you will be able to write tests in many languages after learning about PHPUnit!
